Throw away the fear of failure. Burn the bridges that give a heaven of
safety. Not fearing to step forward and leaving no path back make
moving forward the only way. Do not tarry, but fight from growing
weary.

Failure is good. Constant failure is bad. Failures result from taking
steps outside of the known and comfortable. Failure is even expected,
no person is perfect. Understanding the reason for failure and recovering
is expected. Consistent failure points out a deep flaw that needs
addressing. Fear not failure and instead look forward to the chance to
grow. 

Growth in life comes at the times of trial. No one has grown from
living a casual life. To encourage growth, remove from life what may
bring back a casual life. This may mean leaving friends or moving
across the country. Burning the bridges to the past ensures that it
will not hinder forward movement. Essentially, don't look back, only
forward.

Look back on the day, the week, the month, and the year. Have you been
moving forward? Has fear kept you back? Do some bridges need burning?
