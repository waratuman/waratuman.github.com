<p>Permutations are key to probabilities. A permutation is simply
arranging items in a given set <code>S</code> without regard to
order. If we had a deck with 3 cards in it numbered from 1 to 3, a
total of 6 permutations exists: <code>[1,2,3]</code>,
<code>[1,3,2]</code>, <code>[2,1,3]</code>, <code>[2,3,1]</code>,
<code>[3,1,2]</code> and <code>[3,2,1]</code>.</p>
 
<p>So with a general understanding of what a permutation is, the goal
now is to develop a more abstract idea so that the number of
permutations can be found quickly given <code>n</code> items.</p> 
 
<p>If a deck has <code>n</code> cards in it, how many ways are there
to remove all <code>n</code> cards? When drawing the first card there
are <code>n</code> different possibilities of what that card would
be. The second card that is drawn only has <code>(n-1)</code>
possibilities. This continues until no cards are left. So the number
of ways that all cards from the deck can be drawn is
<code>(n)(n-1)(n-2)...(1)</code>. This is know as the factorial.</p>
 
    <pre><code>(n)(n-1)(n-2)...(1) = n!</code></pre>
 
<p>Now suppose that instead of only taking one item at a time, 2 items
are taken at a time. With a deck of 4 cards numbered 1 to 4 this means
that the permutations of way in which the cards can be drawn are:
<code>[[1,2],[3,4]]</code>, <code>[[2,1],[3,4]]</code>,
<code>[[1,2],[4,3]]</code>, <code>[[2,1],[4,3]]</code>,
<code>[[1,3],[2,4]]</code>, <code>[[3,1],[2,4]]</code>,
<code>[[1,3],[4,2]]</code>, <code>[[3,1],[4,2]]</code>,
<code>[[1,4],[2,3]]</code>, <code>[[4,1],[2,3]]</code>,
<code>[[1,4],[3,2]]</code>, and <code>[[4,1],[3,2]]</code>.</p>
 
<p>So if there is a deck with <code>n</code> cards and <code>k</code>
cards are drawn at a time, how many permutations are there? The
solution takes the following form:</p>
 
<pre><code># The number of permutations of n items taken k at a time.
permutations(n,k) = n! / (n - k)!</code></pre> 
 
<p>Notice that this is equivalent to:</p> 
 
<pre><code>permutations(n,k) = (n)(n-1)...(n-k+1)</code></pre> 
 
<p>This form of the solution will be much more efficienct when it come
to implementing a function in Erlang because instead of calculating 2
factorials and then dividing, it will only do a partial factorial.</p>
 
<h2 id='combinations'>Combinations</h2>
 
<p>Permutations and combinations are similar except that a combination
are not concerned with order. A permutation has <code>k!</code>
duplicate combinations, so the solution is to simply divide the number
of permutations by <code>k!</code>.</p>
 
<pre><code>combinations(n,k) = n! / (k! (n - k)!)
                  = (n)(n-1)...(n-k+1) / k!</code></pre> 
 
<p>This ends the description of permutations and combinations. I am
sure that some things are not clear, as I am working though a book on
probability and statistics and just trying to explain it so that I can
better grasp the subject. If there are any questions or things that
could be clearer, please leave a note in the comments section.</p>
