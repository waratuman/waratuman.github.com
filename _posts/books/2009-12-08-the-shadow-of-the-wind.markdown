### Description

Barcelona, 1945: A city slowly heals from its war wounds, and Daniel,
and antiquarian book dealer's son who mourns the loss of his mother,
finds solace in a mysterious book entitled *The Shadow of the Wind*,
by one Julián Carax. But when he sets out to find the author's other
works, he makes a shocking discovery: someone has been systematically
destroying every copy of every book Carax has written. In fact, Daniel
may have the last of Carax's books in existence. Soon Daniel's
seemingly innocent quest opens a door into one of Barcelona's darkest
secrets---an epic story of murder, madness, and doomed love.
