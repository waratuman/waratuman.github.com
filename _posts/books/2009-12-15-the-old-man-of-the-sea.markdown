### Description

*The Old Man of the Sea* is one of Hemingway's most enduring
 works. Told in language of great simplicity and power, it is the
 story of an old Cuban fisherman, down on his luck, and his supreme
 ordeal---a relentless, agonizing battle with a giant marlin far out
 in the Gulf Stream. Here Hemingway recasts, in strikingly
 contemporary style, the classic theme of courage in the face of
 defeat, of personal triumph won from loss. Written in 1952, his
 hugely successful novella confirmed his power and presence in the
 literary world and played a large part in his winning the 1954 Nobel
 Prize for literature.
