### Description

The quintessential novel of the Lost Generation, *The Sun Also Rises*
is one of Ernest Hemingway's masterpieces and a classic example of his
spare but powerful writing style. A poignant look at the
disillusionment and angst of the post--World War I generation, the
novel introduces two of Hemingway's most unforgettable characters:
Jake Barnes and Lady Brett Ashley. The story follows the flamboyant
Brett and the hapless Jake as they journey from the nightlife of 1920s
Paris to the brutal bullfighting rings of Spain with a motley group of
expatriates. It is an age of moral bankruptcy, spiritual dissolution,
unrealized love, and vanishing illusions. First published in 1926,
*The Sun Also Rises* helped to establish Hemingway as one of the
greatest writers of the twentieth century.
