### Description

At times stern, at other times patient, at times perceptive, at other
times in sad denial, Olive Kitteridge, a retired schoolteacher,
deplores the changes in her little town of Crosby, Maine, and in the
world at large, but she doesn't always recognize the changes in those
around her: a lounge musician haunted by a past romance; a former
student who has lost the will to live; Olive's own adult child, who
feels tyrannized by her irrational sensitivities; and her husband,
Henry, who finds his loyalty to his marriage both a blessing and a
curse.

As the townspeople grapple with their problems, mild and dire, Olive
is brought to a deeper understanding of herself and her
life---sometimes painfully, but always with ruthless honesty. *Olive
Kitteridge* offers profound insights into the human condition---its
conflicts, its tragedies and joys, and the endurance it requires.
